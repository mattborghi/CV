The non-thermal emission of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 was studied, supposing relativistic proton and electron interactions with matter, photons from the CMB and magnetic field, with the goal of explaining the observed spectral energy distribution (SED).

This was made as the final project for the course `Introduction to Relativistic Astrophysics`.
