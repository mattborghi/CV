A minimal working project that handles Microsoft's `Monaco Editor` on the web with `Julia`'s syntax highlighting and a dedicated [`Julia Language Server`](https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl) that allows a certain user to have full access to package documentation, suggestion and snippets.
